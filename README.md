# Week6


Welcome to week 6. 
Next week is multi-layer neural nets. To prepare yourself for that, make sure you understand the following concepts:

1. Preparing data: Importing, scaling, etc
2. Training (fitting) a model, and the python code to do that
3. Testing and calculating accuracy etc
4. Confusion Matrix, Specificity, sensitivity
5. Plotting test and train accuracy with respect to hyperparameters and identifying overfitting
6. k-fold cross validation
7. Hyperparameters, grid search
