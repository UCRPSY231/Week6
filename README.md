Next week is multi-layer neural nets. To prepare yourself for that, make sure you understand the following concepts:

1. Preparing data: Importing, scaling, etc (week 4 - monday)
2. Training (fitting) a model, and the python code to do that (all weeks)
3. Testing and calculating accuracy etc (week 2)
4. Confusion Matrix, Specificity, sensitivity (Set as homework, talked about in week 4)
5. Plotting test and train accuracy with respect to hyperparameters and identifying overfitting (Week 4 - Wed)
6. k-fold cross validation (Week 5)
7. Hyperparameters, grid search (Week 5)
